## Future Work

### General
* Implement for IoT platforms

### SAW Router
* Implement Authentication as native FreeRADIUS module (instead of using exec module)
* On powerful routers: run Ethereum node ourselves (instead of using INFURA)
* Implement pop service in c/c++/go/rust/whatever is lightweight and fast

### Android App
* App could auto-react when the SAW Wifi is chosen
